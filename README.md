# sorVest-vaer-alarm
Just a fun little project to prove a point.

To start there will be a script that checks the MET Weather API for the weather in Bergen and Lindesnes.
It will check which is better/worse and keep a tally of which place had the best weather going forward.
Eventually there could be an app which has a more interactive or readable interface for ease of use.
